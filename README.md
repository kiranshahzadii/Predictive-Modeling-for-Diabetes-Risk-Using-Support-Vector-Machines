# Predictive Modeling for Diabetes Risk Using Support Vector Machines

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to assess the risk of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics and demographic data. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset containing patient information.

## Features
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
- Implementation of the Support Vector Machine algorithm for classification.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization of results to interpret model predictions effectively.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiranshahzadii/diabetes-risk-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd diabetes-risk-prediction
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb
```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the analysis and prediction model.

## Data
The project utilizes a dataset that includes features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and other relevant health indicators to predict diabetes risk.

## Model
The main model used in this project is:
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Results
The SVM model achieved an accuracy of over 90% in predicting diabetes risk, with detailed results and visualizations available in the notebook.
